# Job Search App

This is the backend (Rails API) of the Job Search App. Frontend can be found here: https://github.com/WhitnyNicole/job-search-react-redux. 

This app is meant to be used as a central hub to contain all of your job related resources. Users can create an interview and a review. 

You will need to clone both repositories in order to run this app. Once this repository is cloned, you will run bundle install, rails db:create && rails db:migrate, rails db:seed,and then rails s, the app will automatically start on localhost:3001. Your frontend will run on localhost:3000.
